# Rock Paper Scissors IOS App

Using the guidance of "Intro to App Development with Swift", I was able to create my first IOS app. This is a simple app that mimicks the traditional rock,paper,scissors game againts a computer generated sign.

After finishing the book,  this app is considered the final project. This book is openly available on Apple University, and provided me with the guidance to complete the final project.
